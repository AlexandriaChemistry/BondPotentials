#The RKR data for CO, H2, HF, Li2, LiH, N2, and O2 can be found in the
#literature, as mentioned on p. 210 of the paper. Data for C2, CF, CH, CN, N2+,
#NO and OH were provided to me by Dr. Jorge Luque at SRI International, and I
#have attached them. I would request that you please provide attribution to him
#if you use them in a publication.
